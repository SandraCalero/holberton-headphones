# holberton-headphones

In this project, I am implementing from scratch, without any library, a web page

## Here the final result:

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. You can find final screens [here](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool-webstack/622/Archive.zip)

## Requirements:

- Not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- Not to use Javascript
